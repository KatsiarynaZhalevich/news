This is a GitHub OAuth app and every ear training lesson is a public GitHub repository. You can create your own lessons and publish them on Github to share with other players.<p>All lessons are divided into 12 difficulty levels equal to the amount of notes in chromatic scale. You start learning from level 1 and gradually increase difficulty until you become an expert.<p>If you pass a lesson correctly you are rewarded with silver notes. If you guess 90% of notes you get 1 silver note, 95% - 2, 100% - 3. Later you can use the earned silver notes to give them to the lessons you like. The more silver notes a lesson gets the higher it is displayed on the main page listing. You can also star a lesson on Github and leave a comment. These are social network features of the app that all other similar apps are lacking as well.<p>This is intended to be some kind of a social network of people interested in music education on top of Github. You create and publish your lessons and get comments and stars for them. Every user has a public profile where their achievements and lessons they created are listed.<p>Currently only several initial lessons are created for each difficulty level. But nevertheless the app can already be used as a fully functional ear trainer. New lessons are constantly being added and I hope that more will be created by users.<p>You can play directly in the browser or as PWA on any platform, also Android apk is available for download. Playing is better on mobile, editing - on desktop. To create a new lesson click the edit icon in any existing lesson, then edit it and publish it as yours. I think the editor is self-explanatory. After you have created a lesson it is not shown on the main page until you give it at least one silver note, you can only view it on your profile page.<p>Please tell what you think about it, play it and try to create your own lessons!'

        story_text: 'Hi!<p>Stolbitsa is an ear training app that can use real music for exercises, not just randomly picked notes like all other similar applications. This is a GitHub OAuth app and every ear training lesson is a public GitHub repository. You can create your own lessons and publish them on Github to share with other players.<p>All lessons are divided into 12 difficulty levels equal to the amount of notes in chromatic scale. You start learning from level 1 and gradually increase difficulty until you become an expert.<p>If you pass a lesson correctly you are rewarded with silver notes. If you guess 90% of notes you get 1 silver note, 95% - 2, 100% - 3. Later you can use the earned silver notes to give them to the lessons you like. The more silver notes a lesson gets the higher it is displayed on the main page listing. You can also star a lesson on Github and leave a comment. These are social network features of the app that all other similar apps are lacking as well.<p>This is intended to be some kind of a social network of people interested in music education on top of Github. You create and publish your lessons and get comments and stars for them. Every user has a public profile where their achievements and lessons they created are listed.<p>Currently only several initial lessons are created for each difficulty level. But nevertheless the app can already be used as a fully functional ear trainer. New lessons are constantly being added and I hope that more will be created by users.<p>You can play directly in the browser or as PWA on any platform, also Android apk is available for download. Playing is better on mobile, editing - on desktop. To create a new lesson click the edit icon in any existing lesson, then edit it and publish it as yours. I think the editor is self-explanatory. After you have created a lesson it is not shown on the main page until you give it at least one silver note, you can only view it on your profile page.<p>Please tell what you think about it, play it and try to create your own lessons!',
